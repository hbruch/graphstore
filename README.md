# GraphStore

GraphStore is an in-memory graph structure implementation written in Java. It is designed to be powerful, efficient and robust. It's powering the Gephi software and supports large graphs in intensive applications.

## Features Highlight

* Blazing fast graph data structure optimized for reading and writing. 
* Comprehensive APIs to read and modify the graph structure.
* Low memory footprint. Reduced usage of Java objects and collections optimized for caching.
* Supports directed, undirected and mixed graphs
* Supports parallel edges. Edges can have a label.
* Any number of attributes can be associated with nodes or edges.
* Thread-safe. Implements read-write locking mechanism to allow multiple reading threads.
* Supports dynamic graphs (graphs over time).
* Built-in index on attribute values.
* Fast and compact binary serialization.
